# Arm resurecetion status

* We took the arm down from the loft and powered on the new controller
* Working on getting RS485 pairs tacked onto the right point of the fiber board.   Were unable to establish communications on our initial approach.
* Removed a few components:
  * RS485 line drivers (in case the fiber reciever is dragging the bus down)
  * Bus-terminating resistors
  * Left the TVS diodes
* Seeing a good signal coming out of the controller, but nothing from the arm encoders.
