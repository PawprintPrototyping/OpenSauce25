# Current Status

- Arm works great.  We bought another one, also.
  - The other arm needs a replacement "fiber" board designed and constructed.
    - Really just a substrate for power distrubtion, and RS485 TVS diodes, and the Harting connector.  Should be doable.
- Have our eye on some Arcade-shooter guns in an auction, with the good solenoid bit  
- We applied to exhibit today
  - Applied for a 3-wide booth (8' x 24')
  - 6 - 9 exhibitors to run the booth
  - Our exhibit does not emit ionizing radiation
  - Drew a pretty picture
- Brainstorming reworking the game mechatronics
  - Maybe have the robot arm reset physical targets knocked over by solenoids, instead of moving targets
    - Worry about making that repeatable for a collapsable setup, I don't want to have to retrain locations (Rechner)
  - Make the side targets do something more interesting than flail
  - Maybe additoinal targets clipped randomly to the fence?
