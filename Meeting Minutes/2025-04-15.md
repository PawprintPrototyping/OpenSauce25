# What do we even want to do?

## Target improvements over last year

1. Lubricate the robot
1. Get it working to MVP (basic gameplay from last year)
1. Make the robot movement a real program on the controller
  1. Primary interface then becomes a pause/continue command
1. Make the guns better (physically, and target accuracy)
1. Better and more side targets (increased difficulty)
1. Decouple the side linear actuators from the frame, so we can more easily assemble/disassemble/reconfigure
2. Fun additions:
  1. Receipt printout of your high score
  2. Also rediculous up-shot of your face when you least expect it
 

# Goal for next week
1. Lube the arm
1. Get the old game set up and playable
