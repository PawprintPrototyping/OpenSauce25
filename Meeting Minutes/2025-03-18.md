* It works!
  * After removing the RS485 line drivers and terminating resistors from the fiber board, we have working communications and motion with the new controller.
  * Old parts are taped to a business card inside the cover of the manual
* Gripper also functions, but we are missing a part of the mounting adapter flange.  Asked Bocuma to help figure out a mounting solution
* Tanuki to inquire with Noisebridge to see if they still have the track, so the robot can be more powerful than ever
* Made a backup of the firmware and NVRAM using [these utilities](https://github.com/PawprintPrototyping/crs-c500c-utils).
* Our version of ROBCOM apparently much older than I thought, so windows software doesn't work.  At least we have the onboard editor and compiler now.
* Using the code from the above forked repo, we now have the option to drive motion over serial with better feedback than with the shell.
* Rechner will also dump the firmware and NVRAM from our backup controller.

# Action items

* Should order parts to reterminate arm communications as RS485

* Start thinking about how we're actually going to use the darn thing.  Should we just juzsh up the previous ARM premise, or use the robot for something new?
  * A couple of Pros:
    * ARM shooter is interactive
    * Timer makes for a great natural end to keep participants from hogging it forever
    * Competition is fun prelude for small prizes
    * Building on what we've already got frees some cycles to work on other stuff to show off
